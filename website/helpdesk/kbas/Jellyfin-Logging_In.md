# Logging into Jellyfin

Jellyfin uses your ECLS username and password to login. 

* If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you will not need to append a code to the password field to login.
* If you have not previously used Jellyfin, you will need to login once for your account to be automatically created.
* For devices like TVs, it's recommended to use Quick Connect to login instead. You can access Quick Connect in Jellyfin by selecting the profile icon in the top right of your screen and selecting 'Quick Connect' from the list.
