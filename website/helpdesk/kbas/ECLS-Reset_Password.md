# Reset your ECLS Password

**Important!**  If you use Discord to sign into ECLS, you should change your password through the user interface instead of using account recovery.

You can visit [this page](https://login.enstrayed.com/if/flow/recovery/) to have a password reset link sent to the email associated with your ECLS account.

**Please make sure to check your spam folder.**

If you are unable to access that email address, [open a ticket](/helpdesk/ticket/new) with the topic "ECLS Account Recovery" instead.
