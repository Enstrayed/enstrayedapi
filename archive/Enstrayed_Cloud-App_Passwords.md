# Using App Passwords on Enstrayed Cloud

App Passwords are credentials used to access your Enstrayed Cloud account from a specific application or device. They are created automatically for many Nextcloud clients, or can be created manually using the steps below. 

**As Enstrayed Cloud exclusively uses ECLS for sign on, you will need to create app passwords for any device that does not support browser login.**

To create an App Password:

1. Login to Enstrayed Cloud
